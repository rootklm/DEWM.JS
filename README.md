# DEWM.JS
Desktop Environment/Window Manager built using Web technologies

The html runs directly on x/wayland in a recompiled version of firefox that only has the modules for gecko (the html parser) and websockets.

The interface is constructed dynamically from system information gathered from Ajax calls. 

Apps are rendered using websockets and ssh, powered by node.js
